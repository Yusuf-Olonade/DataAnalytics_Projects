## Analyzing Customer Attrition in Excel and Power BI

Databel is a fictional telecom company experiencing customer churn, they
want to understand the root cause of this problem and develop a strategy 
to tackle it. I analyzed the data and found that the current churn rate is
26.86%. The main churn reasons are competitor, attitude of support person, 
dissatisfaction and high price. Databel's major customers are between 30-65 yrs, 
on a month-to-month contract and pay with direct debit, they have significantly 
higher churn rate. I also found that customers in a group contract have lower 
monthly charge and churn rate. Customers without unlimited data plan but use 
extra data, those without int plan but call internationally all incur extra charges 
leading to higher customer service calls and churn rate. Follow the link in the 
overview page below to access the interactive report in Power BI.

## Analyzing Product Sales Strategy with Python

A fictional office stationery supply company called Pens and Printers
have just lauched a new product line and have tried different sales strategies
including Email, Call and Email + Call. The goal of this project is to analyze
the data and recommend the best strategy. After my analysis, I found that Email
was the best as it accounted for the highest revenue and quantity of products sold,
about 50% of the total. It also reached the highest number of customers with 
the fastest response time within 2.5 weeks. In addition it had the least cost to 
the sales team making it the best strategy to maximize profit.
